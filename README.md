# React Movie Cards

A basic application that displays a list of movies as a list of cards. Each card provides movie details such as title, subtitle, description, image, and rating.

Go **[here](http://react-movie-cards.drminnaar.me/)** for live demo.

This is a good example of using nested components because it illustrates a nesting of components 3 levels deep. A _Movie_ component has a _MovieList_ component has a _MovieCard_ component has a _StarRating_ component. The _Movie_ component also uses a service called _MovieService_ to retrieve a list of movies (this is from a json document).

Futhermore, I have configured webpack to make use of the [copy-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-webpack-plugin) to copy images into the _public_ folder. I have also included the [json-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-loader) to load my movie collection from a json file called movies.json.

For styling, I have adopted bootstrap4 beta. I use SCSS for all custom written styles.

The application is composed of the following components:

* Header - A heading that displays application title

* Movies - The primary (root) component that manages state for Movies and all underlying components. It is also responsible for connecting to _MovieService_ to retrieve movie data

* MovieList - Groups a collection of movies

* MovieCard - Represents a single instance of a movie

* StarRating - Indicates average rating of a movie as a list of 5 stars

The following services are used to obtain movie data:

* MovieService - A wrapper that retrieves data from a json file containing a list of movies
